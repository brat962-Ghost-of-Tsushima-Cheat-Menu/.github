## 🧰 What Is the Ghost of Tsushima Cheat Menu?

The **cheat menu** is basically a secret dev-style control panel you unlock using a trainer, cheat loader, or modded overlay. Unlike basic trainers, this menu gives you **real-time toggles**, visual tweaks, enemy manipulation, movement boosts, and even environmental control.

Think:

* Turning off AI detection
* Changing weather for cinematic fights
* Flying across the map
* Dropping enemy squads instantly
* Full stat editing mid-mission

Yep, it’s like having admin access to the samurai world 🐉
